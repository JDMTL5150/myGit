# Mini Git Implementation
----
This is a personal project I am building alongside my studies.

The goal is to create a simplified implementation of Git to better understand how version control systems work internally.  
Instead of using Git as a tool, this project focuses on recreating core functionality such as commits, branches, and repository structure from scratch.

This project is mainly for learning purposes and is a work in progress.

## Features (Planned / In Progress)
- Repository initialization
